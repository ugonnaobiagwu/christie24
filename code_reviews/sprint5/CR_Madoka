Each method aren't too long, and the method names have an appropriate names for its functions. In addition. the first letter of the method names are all capitalized.
Parameters aren't too much.
The class size is't too big. 
Neatly formatted

comment out unnecessary or unused codes (i.e:  //public Direction ScrollDirection;)
Make Sure to get all magic numbers out. Not only numerical values but also strings (such as "play")

Neatly organized and the method names and variables are well formed, so it was easy to read. 

Over all there aren't much change I would ask for as for readability. There are not magic numbers, so it was easy to read on the functionality of the codes.

The only thing I would recommend is to remove the codes that are commented out.
