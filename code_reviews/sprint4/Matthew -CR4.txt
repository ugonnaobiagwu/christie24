Sprint 4
Name of File: AnimationParser.cs
C Sharp Author: Ryan Greene
Time Taken: 5 Minutes
Notes: On first pass – file is very lacking in comments, adding comments to ParseAnimation and ParseAnimationSet are very dense and could use them! Otherwise methods are compact and file fits in one screen – yay.

Sprint 4
Name of File: XMLParser.cs
C Sharp Author: Ryan Greene
Notes: File is separated into methods based on each game object, method names make the aspects of the file easy to parse, but comments would be useful within methods to understand them. 
Otherwise file is well written and functions well within game.
