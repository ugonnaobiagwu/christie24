Time Taken: 5 Minutes
Notes: A lot of the functions are kept simple and for one purpose, which is good. The main issue with readability is the strange variation in indentation. 
There appears to be little reason why some things are formatted the way they are.  The use of comments does a long way in helping understandability.

Notes: This file is about as simple as it needs to be. There is no unnecessary methods or methods that handle too many situations. One issue I could see is the various Update() methods.
I may be misunderstanding their function, however I assume many could be combined into single functions or handled from a universal source.
Recommendation: You could create a list of delegates that holds a string and a method such that, when you need to activate a specific entity, you get it from the list and call it. 
This would just condesne a few functions into one and would make it a little more maintainable since all of the action comes from one source.
