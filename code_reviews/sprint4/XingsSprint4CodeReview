Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
  Overall, relatively easy to read. All the names of the variables and methods are pretty self-explanatory.
  getDirection() cases can definitely be written in order from 0 to 3 instead of 1,3,0,2 but that's just me being a little OCD. 
  Could use a few more comments, but not necessary as the naming and methods are pretty clear and short.

Specific comments on code quality:
  I noticed that in contrary to Otorok, width, and height aren't variables you declare in the public Skeleton() class (in contrary where it is in Otorok()).
  Since you noted that it is a temporary value, it might be better if you do declare it in Skeleton() depending on what it changes based on.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to the file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
  Make width and height variables as noted above.
