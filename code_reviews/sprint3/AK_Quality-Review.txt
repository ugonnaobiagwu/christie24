Sprint 3

LinkFactory.cs
Matthew Dannery

+ Every variable contains a get and set to easily be changed
+ Uses keyword strings for link's items to make it easier to work with other classes
- Uses magic numbers for animations, could be an issue if animation needs to be adjusted

Proposed change:
Initialize the frame numbers for the animations in the constructor in order to more easily edit them if there needs to be a change to the sprite sheet.
