CONTROLS:
* Use W, A, S, D to walk around.
* Press I to open the Inventory and from there, use the ARROW keys to select an item, then equip to an item slot by pressing A or B
* Attack Using Item A with N
* Attack Using Item B with M
* Pause the game with P.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES:
* Fun Fact: Collision Rectangles are slightly off because the images use a float for scaling, but the width and height gets the decimal value truncated. White space in the SpriteSheets don't help either.
* Certain Song files fade out and start again. Purely because thats how the file was ripped.
* Some animations don't actually animate.


Please visit the issues for additional bugs that may not have been addressed here. This, by no means, is an exhaustive list.
