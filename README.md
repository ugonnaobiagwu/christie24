KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES:
* Link and Item Animations: Really wonky right now. Item Sprite switches don't work, and Link;s "UseItem" pose remains once the item is out of usage.
* Item Locations: Bows and Swords come from special directions and are oriented to meet that criteria, but their rotations are out of wack currently.
* Unregistered Keys cause game to crash.
* Collision Detector / Handler have issues to be sorted out.


Please visit the issues for additional bugs that may not have been addressed here. This, by no means, is an exhaustive list.
