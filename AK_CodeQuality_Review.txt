Notes:
+ Dictionary ensures that each sound will have an instance that can be easily depicted
+ Pause, Stop, and Resume methods make implementation with other methods less jumbled
- Dictionary having the song being the key, leads to potential for multiple songs playing at the same time.

Suggested Fix:
	Have the key of the Dictionary be the instance, because only 1 song should be playing for each instance, while hypothetically, you
could have multiple occurences where you would want to play the same song.
